# Provide insights into potential reasons for the lower fire incidents in that country
# Factors contributing to lower fire incidents could include:
# 1. Climate conditions: Cooler, wetter climates may reduce fire risk.
# 2. Geographical features: Regions with less forest cover or natural barriers to fire spread.
# 3. Effective fire management strategies: Implementation of robust prevention and suppression measures.
# 4. Adequate resources: Sufficient funding and equipment for fire monitoring and response.
# 5. Public awareness and education: Strong community engagement in fire safety practices.
