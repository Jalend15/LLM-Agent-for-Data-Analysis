Rationale:
Based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the identified principal component captures the variance in the dataset related to both total fire size and total fire count. The county with the highest value on this component exhibits a combination of significant fire size and frequency, indicating it as the most fire-prone county. Conversely, the county with the lowest value on the principal component reflects lower fire size and frequency, hence classified as the least fire-prone county.
